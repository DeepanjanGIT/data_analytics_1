Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis using a combination of SQL and Python. The focus is on extracting insights from business data (such as sales, orders, or customer behavior) by leveraging the power of SQL for data manipulation and Python for further analysis.

üîß Tech Stack
SQL: PostgreSQL (for querying and aggregating data)

Python:

pandas for data manipulation

jupyter notebook or .py script for analysis

Extracted yearly sales data using SQL with CTEs and aggregation.

Compared sales across different years and sub-categories.

Identified top-performing product categories based on year-over-year growth.

Visualized sales trends using Python.
